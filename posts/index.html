<h3 id="marnix0810_19829_1">FNew has completely moved from Zeronet to the open internet</h3>
<hr>
Some time ago, <a href="https://marnix0810.wordpress.com/2019/08/15/fnew-is-being-moved-from-zeronet-to-the-open-internet/" target="_blank">I posted to decide moving</a> FNew to the open internet because it didn't work out between FNew and P2P.<br></br>
But for a while the moving just made it impossible to use FNew at a usefull way, because FNew's code was not adapted to it's new environment. It is now, and more.

<hr>
Hello, this is the first post on FNew! I am happy to welcome anyone who reads this.<br>
Anyone-can-write, well... IF YOU CAN, and if you have an email-adress...<br>
<h4>Why did I create FNew?</h4>
Well, actually i don't know. I have tried it a couple of years ago on the Ournet, which is an app which search for one ip hosting a 7z containing the oursites... But I stopped developing the Ournet and removed all the files, including the FNew original.<br>
Anyway, I started it over, here we are.

<h4>Why is FNew on Zeronet?</h4>
Uhh, mostly because I can't afford hosting costs... But also because of the cool concept of the peer-to-peer network! ðŸ˜‰<br>
