# Contributing to FNew
## In feedback
Okay, if you notice an issue in FNew, please notify us! But also, please follow these guidelines:
### Be clear
You have to be specific, if you aren't we simply don't know enough to help. Please share everything you think we need!
### Don't be too specific
If you give us too much information, we won't be able to filter the important stuff out. Don't tell us too much, but rule 1 still applies.
### Be up-to-date
If we have already put out a word that says were fixing the issue, please just trust us.

## In code

Since FNew is a website, the most of it's code is HTML, the latest [FNew Standards](https://github.com/0810-Software/FNew-HTML/tree/master/standards) must be followed-up, also: you can edit th content of the site, but don't change the message it's sending.
