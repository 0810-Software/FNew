# The FNew ‘everyone-can-post-and-read’-Social Media Site's Github repository.

Welcome to our Github repository!

## What is in this repository?

- The FNew pages, posts and site's HTML code
- (Future plans) Code that helps me to keep everything on rails. *(actually, there is a new repository for that, [0810-Software/FNew-PHP](https://github.com/0810-Software/FNew-PHP).*)

## Okay, what is FNew?

FNew is a social media site using a 'everyone can see'-policy, which also means no fear for private conversations leaking, etcetera. Everything goes trough me, no automated process (yet).
