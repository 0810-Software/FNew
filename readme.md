# The FNew ‘everyone-can-post-and-read’-Social Media Site's Github repository.

	<h1 color="red">FNew is stopping!</h1>
	<p color="red">FNew is not being used at all but costs me (Marnix Bloeiman) money, for the past year I hoped to bring change into that, but today I decided to stop FNew and it's services, as well as developement of ALL versions.</p>
Welcome to our Github repository!

## What is in this repository?

- The FNew pages, posts and site's HTML code
- (Future plans) Code that helps me to keep everything on rails. *(actually, we have started to do that, [the alpha branch](https://github.com/0810-Software/FNew/blob/alpha/readme.md).*)

## Okay, what is FNew?

FNew is a social media site using a 'everyone can see'-policy, which also means no fear for private conversations leaking, etcetera. Everything goes trough me, no automated process (yet).
