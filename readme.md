# The FNew ‘everyone-can-post-and-read’-Social Media Site's Github repository.

Welcome to our Github repository!

## What is in this repository?

- The FNew pages, posts and site (using Github Pages)
- (Future plans) The releases of the client apps.
- (Future plans) Code that helps me to keep everything on rails.

## Okay, what is FNew?

FNew is a social media site using a 'everyone can see'-policy, which also means no fear for private conversations leaking, etcetera. Everything goes trough me, no automated process.
